# Blackboard Autologin

GMU's Blackboard is set to log you out after a crazy short amount of time. This
plugin help to mediate that my automatically pressing the login button when you
arrive at the login page. Assuming your browser is configured to send the
correct password etc. it should work fine. It could potentially send your
browser into an infinate loop though, you could probably stop it just by
temporarily disableing GreaseMonkey.
